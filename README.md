# This is a repo to practice git and github

## Not sure what to put in here

But we will start with a README file.

'''bash

git add README.md

'''

### This is just a change to test the git commit -a option
Which just commits all files that are already tracked and have been changed.

### Just testing again. This time I am testing different branches.
I called this one branch-test
