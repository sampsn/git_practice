# This is a repo to practice git and github

## Not sure what to put in here

But we will start with a README file.

'''bash

git add README.md

'''

### This is just a change to test the git commit -a option
Which just commits all files that are already tracked and have been changed.

### Just testing again. This time I am testing different branches.
I called this one branch-test

### Testing branch conflicts in a fake "emergency_fix" branch


I made a branch called emergency_fix and added a line to this file. Then I merged it with main.
This means that the current readme file that is in "branch_test" branch is not the same as what has been merged with main.
Should cause a conflict and we can learn!

I am now in the readme after getting the merge conflict. It automatically showed the differences between the files
here in the editor, which is awesome! Now I will edit it to be clean and ready for merging.
